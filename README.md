# crime-prediction

Crimes are the significant threat to the human kind. There are many 
crimes that happen at regular interval of time. Perhaps it is increasing and 
spreading at a fast and vast rate. Crimes happen from small village, town to 
big cities. 
Crimes are of different type – robbery, murder, rape, assault, 
battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping, homicide. Since crimes are 
increasing there is a need to solve the cases in a much faster way. The crime 
activities have been increased at a faster rate and it is the responsibility of 
police department to control and reduce the crime activities. 

Crime prediction and criminal identification are the major problems to the police 
department as there are tremendous amount of crime data that exist. There is 
a need of technology through which the case solving could be faster. The 
aim of this project is to make crime prediction using the features present in 
the dataset.

The dataset is extracted from the official sites. With the help of 
machine learning algorithm, using python as core we can predict the type of 
crime which will occur in a particular area. Through many documentation 
and cases, it came out that machine learning and data science can make the 
work easier and faster. The inputs to our algorithms are year, state, district 
and class of crime:



• Act 379 - Robbery
• Act 13 - Gambling
• Act 279 - Accident
• Act 323 - Violence
• Act 302 - Murder
• Act 363 – Kidnapping



The output is the class of crime that is likely to have occurred. We 
try out multiple classification algorithms, such as Linear regression, Support 
Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression and Random Forests.
Crime rate forecast is a scheme that uses different algorithms to 
determine the crime rate based on prior information. For our daily purposes 
we must go many places every day and many times in our daily we face 
numerous security issues such as hijacking, kidnapping, harassment, etc. In 
general, we see that we are searching for Google Maps when we need to go 
anywhere at first, Google Maps show that one, two or more ways to get to 
the destination, but we always choose the shortcut route, but we do not 
comprehend the path condition properly. Is it safe or not that’s why we are 
faced with many unpleasant circumstances; this research introduces the 
design and execution of a strategy based on past crime data and analyzes the 
crime rate in past areas at distinct moments; for this work, we use primary 
data those are collected from the people based on their previous crime 
problem. 

In our train information collection, we used different algorithms to 
figure out the highest precision between the Linear Regression algorithms 
that provides the greatest precision. In this paper, we use different models 
and table to show the different types of crime rate, mostly working data from 
last 7 years of crime and showing the level of crime prediction in different 
issues described in Sect.

Dataset platforms:
• Kaggle
• Open.gov.in
• India crime record bureau

Objective:
The prediction using machine learning techniques that is prediction 
rules. Frequent patterns are extracted based on the criteria’s like crime 
type. Prediction is done based on the previous year datasets. The prediction 
report consists of all the datasets from the year 2015-2022.the year wise 
comparison is shown based on the state wise datasets. The clustering 
algorithm can be perform based on every datasets based on each year 
comparison is made
